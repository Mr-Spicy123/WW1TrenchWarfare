        <p>Initially, both sides anticipated lots of movement during the war. Germany was executing the Schlieffen Plan, which was to take over France by going through Belgium to avoid the heavily armed borders and sweep Paris in just 6 weeks, winning the war. The Germans underestimated Belgiumâ€™s force, which slowed their plan down. After eventually getting through Belgium and into France, Germany began the movement to sweep Paris. However, the French surprise-attacked the Germans, initiating the First Battle of the Marne. The French, with some help from Britain, stopped the advancements of the Germans, and both sides dug into the ground, creating the trench system and setting the scene for World War One on the western front.</p>
