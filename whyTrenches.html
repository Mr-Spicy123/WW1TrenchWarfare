    <div class="info-pair-type1">
        <p>Initially, both sides anticipated lots of movement during the war. Germany executed their plan to take over France and win the war. This was called the Schlieffen plan, proposed initially in 1905 by Alfred von Schlieffen. Since Germany’s border with France was too heavily protected to invade, Germany planned to invade through Belgium and enter France through their border with Belgium. From there, they would mobilize around Paris, taking it over, and make their way back into Germany through their border with France. All this was planned to happen in just six weeks. When Germany executed this plan, they underestimated Belgium’s military power, which slowed them down. Eventually, they made their way into France and were reaching Paris when suddenly, The French surprise-attacked Germany, initiating the First Battle of the Marne.</p>

        <p>The First Battle of the Marne began with the French attacking Germany’s 1st army from the west, making them swing even further west, creating a large gap between Germany's 1st and 2nd army. Despite this vulnerability, it wasn’t looking good for the French, until they received 6000 reinforcements with the use of 630 taxicabs that came from France. This counterattack came as a shock to the Germans and became a turning point of the battle. The Germans were stuck in place and decided they needed to dig into the ground, creating trenches to avoid enemy fire. The British troops moved into the gap between the two German armies, pushing them back. The Germans began retreating from battle, making the Schlieffen plan a failure, and creating the idea of trench warfare, which stuck for the entire war on the western front.</p>
