                <p>France's trenches were built with the assumption that the war would be over in a matter of weeks. So, they were built in poorer quality than the German's trenches which were built to last. This was a huge flaw because it made living conditions in the trenches extremely unbearable.</p>
                <p>France's trenches were narrow, muddy, rat infested, and vulnerable to the new weapons of WW1. All of these factors added onto the fact the job of the soldiers were to shoot as many people as possible is what made their lives in the trenches misserable. Needless to say, the trenches were no place to call home.</p>
                <p>The trenches were built as a three trench system. This is what the trenches on both sides had in common. The first trench, closest to the enemy, was called the 'Front-Line Trench'. This was the trench responsible for gunning down the enemy. The middle trench, called the Support Trench, was used to transport injured soldiers to get treated at the field hospitals. The final trench was called the Reserve Trench and was used in case soldiers needed to retreat from battle and also acted as a relatively safe place to keep supplies.</p>
