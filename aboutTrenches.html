        <p>Trench warfare in World War One took place at Germany's western front which is its border with France. The trench system spanned from Belgium, down to Switzerland, mainly running throughout France. France's trenches were used by the triple entente and their colonies. Likewise, the German's trenches were used by the triple alliance and their colonies. The two trench systems were separated by several hundred metres of land referred to as 'no man's land'.</p>

        <p>When France built their trenches, they were under the assumption that the war would be over in just a matter of weeks so, they were built with poor quality. They were muddy, rat-infested, and vulnerable to attack with the weapons of WW1. This made the living conditions terrible for the soldiers. However, the Germans built their trenches to last, so they were of much higher quality than the French.</p>
        <p>The trenches were built in a system of three parallel trenches connected by adjacent trenches. The three-trench system was used by both the French, and Germans. The first trench, closest to the enemy, was called the front-line trench and was used for shooting the enemy with machine guns. The second trench, called the support trench, was used to transport injured soldiers to field hospitals. The third trench, at the back, was called the reserve trench and was used in case the soldiers needed to retreat from battle. It also acted as a safe place to keep supplies. These were all connected by parallel trenches called communication trenches and were used to transport soldiers and supplies. All the trenches were not straight lines, but zigzags so that the enemy couldn't shoot through the trench, killing all the men.</p>
