        <p>The trenches in World War One were rat-infested, muddy, and vulnerable to attack from the weapons of WW1. Soldiers lived extremely uncomfortably while still persevering through these terrible conditions and fought the enemy.  France’s trenches had much worse conditions than Germany’s because they were built with the assumption that the war would be over in weeks. Germany made no assumption and built their trenches to last which made the living conditions for the Germans and their allies better in contrast to the other side. </p>

        <p>These conditions had long-term effects on soldiers during and after the war. Soldiers would stand in muddy water every day which literally rotted their feet causing what's known as trench foot. This would infect their foot and, in some cases, resulted in an amputation of the toes or the foot entirely. Another big effect was the lice and diseases being spread from the large rats that infested the trenches and tormented the soldiers. This rat infestation only grew and there became millions of rats in the trenches.</p>
