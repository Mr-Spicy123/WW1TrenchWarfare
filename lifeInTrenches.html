        <p>The trenches in World War One were rat-infested, muddy, and vulnerable to attack from the weapons of WW1. Soldiers lived extremely uncomfortably while still persevering through these terrible conditions and fought the enemy.  France’s trenches had much worse conditions than Germany’s because they were built with the assumption that the war would be over in weeks. Germany made no assumption and built their trenches to last which made the living conditions for the Germans and their allies better in contrast to the other side. </p>

        <p>These conditions had long-term effects on soldiers during and after the war. Soldiers would stand in the mud every day which literally rotted their feet causing what's known as trench foot. This would infect their foot and, in some cases, resulted in an amputation of the toes or the foot entirely. Another big effect was the lice and diseases, like trench fever, being spread from the giant rats that infested the trenches and tormented the soldiers.</p>

        <p>Arguably the worst and longest-term effect of WW1 on the soldiers is what they called ‘shell shock’, which we now know as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. Soldiers with shell shock were immediately sent home, and since no one really knew what it was, it was associated with soldiers just being cowards and giving up. Soldiers with PTSD would have dreams about a particular traumatic event during the war, although these dreams would occur anywhere; they could be having a conversation with someone and have a dream occur, sending their mind back to that event. Soldiers would also have extreme emotional and physical reactions to things that reminded them of the war. They would be easily startled, suffer extreme anxiety, and always on guard from danger, even in a completely safe place.</p>
